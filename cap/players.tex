\section{Players}

Players are the ones wagering the money, we define its number to 2, however
  when gambling there could be more than two players. Usually we will refer to
  them as ``Player A'' and ``Player B''. Players are the ones paying the bet,
  the oracles and the transactions fees. The one who predicts correctly the
  outcome of the event they are betting on takes the prize.
