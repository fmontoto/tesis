\section{Hash functions}
A hash function is a mapping from a set of arbitrary size to a set of a fixed
  size.
The range has only elements of the same size
If we represent the data in binary, the range is bounded by $2^n$ where n
  is the size in bits of the output.
The domain of the function in principle can be unbounded, and by the
  \textit{Pigeonhole Principle:}
\begin{equation}
    \exists \, i, j \mid f(i) = f(j), \, i \neq j
\end{equation}
When this happen, we say there is a collision, and for most uses of a Hash
  function are unwanted.

Hash functions are used for many things: File comparison, instead of comparing
  files bit to bit, the image of a Hash Function can be compared instead;
  Hash-Tables, this allows quick lookups for the elements; Finding similar
  records, by using a Hash Function that produces similar images for similar
  pre-images, etc..

\section{Image of a hash function}

If not stated otherwise we will use the word ``Hash'' to denote the image of
  some data using a Hash Function.

\section{Cryptographic hash function}
This refers to a special class of Hash Functions the cryptography has defined
  to be suitable for its use on cryptographic applications. These functions are
  designed to be ``one way'' functions, meaning it is unfeasible\footnote{We %
  say something is computationally unfeasible when even it is computable, it
  will require far too many resources to do it.} to invert if the input to the
  function is chosen uniformly at random.

In an ideal cryptographic function, the most efficient way to find one of the
  preimages is by a brute-force search\footnote{Also known as exhaustive search,
  consisting of enumerating all the potential solutions and checking which of
  them satisfies the predicate}. We call this property
  \textit{preimage-resistance}.
It is also important for this ideal function to be \textit{collision
  resistant}, this means it is unfeasible to find a collision, that is: any two
  distinct inputs $x, x'$ with the same image, i.e., such that $h(x) = h(x')$.

When using this ideal function, on average, producing a (second) preimage
  requires $2^n$ operations, and producing a collision requires at least
  $2^{n / 2} $ operations \cite{preneel1993analysis}.
