Since the Bitcoin creation in 2008 more than a thousands of different
  cryptocurrencies have been created, most of them following its main design
  properties.
Bitcoin is known and often criticized because its slow evolution and resistance
  to changes.
This is accentuated by the overwhelming number of different and fast evolving
  currencies created.

A currency where rules does not change too much over time makes it a good store
  for value, and likely this Bitcoin's property contributes to make it the
  most valuable cryptocurrency, as measured by market capitalization.
This is a desired feature for our algorithm, we do not want the value of the
  money put when the bet is placed to be too different of the one when the bet
  is resolved.

However, using Bitcoin did not come for free, this slow change rate keeps
  bitcoin script language very limited.
When people talk about smart contract or scripting, Bitcoin is never the first
  currency coming to people's mind.
The limited scripting, slow change rate and the biggest network made Bitcoin our
  choice:
The script limitation poses a real challenge in the protocol presented, making this
  an open problem.
As we discussed at Section~\ref{sec:discussion_previous_work}, the problem has
  many implemented solutions for currencies with more expressive scripting
  languages.
Bitcoin's slow change rate helps to keep the currency value and the same rules
  from the start to the end of a bet, thus making the platform suitable for long
  term bets.
Finally, having the largest network enforcing the protocol rules makes more
  difficult some known attacks, as Majority and Eclipse
  \cite{heilman2015eclipse}, where attackers can overtake the control of the
  network or part of it.
Other cost of using a limited scripting language is the amount of instructions
  and transactions required to express the protocol, which translates into
  somewhat a higher costs.

The cost of running our proposed algorithm may be prohibitively expensive for
  some cases.
But we think there is people willing to pay the cost when doing bet on large
  sums of money, as the cost of the protocol would represent a small fraction of
  the bet.
Notice that the const does not increase with the amount of money involved.

Most of the transaction required by the protcol are called ``Non standard''
  in Bitcoin.
Meaning even they are valid transactions and everyone recognizes them as that.
Most of the miners will not mine them, so likely submitting the transactions
  will take more time than a standard one.
We hope new proposals that makes use of this available features, like this one,
  can move the Bitcoin community to embrace this ``non estandard'' transactions.

One of the most challenging problems to resolve for this protocol was to
  translate the protocol restrictions to Bitcoin transactions.
Studied existing solutions are composed just by one or two different
  transactions.
In Ethereum one smart contract is enough for the applications we discussed at
  Section~\ref{sec:previous_work}.
For Orisi, only one transaction is post in the blockchain with the bet, all
  the other communication and set up required happens outside the blockchain.
Our protocol uses the blochain widely, not only for money transfers, but also
  for oracle discovery and initial communication.
This seeks to avoid extra dependecies and keep most of the protocol expressed
  in the same framework.
This come to a cost, more and larger transactions.
Which are not free anymore, for each byte we post in the blockchain within
  a transaction we are charged by the miner.
This cost is discussed at Section~\ref{sec:cost_analysis}

A good example of this complexity is the transaction show in
  Section~\ref{app:winner_collect}.
Bitcoin provides a multi-sig check function, which verifies if certain number
  if signatures of the provided public keys are present.
At the Bet transaction we need to implement our own version of this
  cryptographic primitive, to get a multi-hash check function, which checks
  at least threshold preimages are provided for the written hash.
This transaction is hard to read as it can not be written using loops (because
  the language does not support them), and even not used branches need to be
  included to match the original hash in the Bet transaction output.

The initial decision of implementing the protocol prove to be very helpful when
  investi\-ga\-ting limitations of the protocol.
It allowed us to calculate the size of the required transactions, which were
  used to get a very accurate cost of the fees per transaction.
Other limitation found thanks the implementation was the maximum size of an
  element on the Bitcoin stack: 520 bytes.
Due this limitation our original implementation was able to use up to 6 oracles,
  after some script optimizations our implementatio support up to 7 oracles.
With other optimizations we might be able to support one or two more oracles.
However, without a change in the way Pay To Script Hash transactions work, or
  the hard limit of 520 bytes per element in the stack.
It is impossible for our protocol to support a bigger number of oracles.

Many of the work on the implementation were basic tools to manipulate and
  generate custom transactions.
This code is a contribution not only for our protocol, but also for people
  willing to use the bitcoin with custom transactions, as we do.

Gambling is a really big and heavily regulated industry, Winsomeio, oraclizeit
  and this protocol are tools to make this industry more flexible.
They aim to allow people to fully control its money while gambling, contrarily
  to from the regular casinos or bet sites.
As cryptocurrencies allows people to stay away from a centralized government
  issuer, this kind of tools allows people to steer out from centralized
  gambling sites.
There is yet another big difference, people running protocols on top of
  blockchains can see every line of code executed and how decissions are taken,
  making gambling a transparent process, opossed as it is today.
Where people uses only the public interface of a web site or physical casino.
Never seeing what is really going on ``behind the scenes''.

We believe this work is a contribution for both worlds, it introduces new
  options on the gambling industry.
And also adds a new application on top of Bitcoin, using it as more than a
  value store currency.
Bitcoin introduces a method to store and transfer value without relying in a
  central authority as previous currencies did before.
The presented protocol uses this property and introduces an option to do
  these transfers subject to real world events, while keeping the lack
  of central control to achieve it.
Therefore the objective for this work is accomplished.

While working on this we realized bets are only one example of external
  people or events deciding destination of somebody else's money.
We could think in our oracles as ``judges'' in a dispute.
And instead of providing an event outcome into the blockchain, they can
  decide on any subject, acting as arbiter on a controversy.

Small adjustements would be required to the protocol, as removing the random
  selection, probably judges will be agreed beforehand by the players.
Other required change is to remove the penalization by answering different
  from the majority.
It is perfectly fine and even desirable to have different opinions among the
  judges, and the ones with the minority should not be punished.

It might be also desirable to have a larger number of oracles participating in
  a bet.
However, this requires a change in the Bitcoin implementaion, which is not
  under our control.

Future work might also include sharing oracles among different Bets.
This could help on making the protocol cheaper but adds new issues, as paying
  the oracle.
Our proposal pays the oracles in the same Bet transaction, get all the users to
  finance the oracles would require a new way to do it.

Other interesting change would be to decrease the transactions number or
  transactions' size to make the fees more affordables.
One of the last additions to Bitcoin was ``Segregated Witness'', it solves
  transaction malleability, which opens the door to the use of off the blockchain
  transactions.
This is an option to decrease the number of required transactions posted in the
  blockchain, and therefore decrease the amount of fees paid.
