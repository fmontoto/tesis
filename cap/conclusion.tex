Since the Bitcoin creation in 2008 more than a thousands of different
  cryptocurrencies have been created, most of them following its main design
  properties.
Bitcoin is known and often criticized because its slow evolution and resistance
  to changes.
This is accentuated for the overwhelming number of different and fast evolving
  currencies created.

A currency where rules does not change too much over time makes it a good store
  for value, and likely this property of bitcoin contributes to make it the
  most valuable cryptocurrency, as measured by market capitalization.
This is a desired feature for our algorithm, we don't want the value of the
  money put when the bet is placed to be too different of the one when the bet
  is resolved.

However this did not come for free, this slow change rate keeps bitcoin script
  language very limited.
When people talk about smart contract or scripting, Bitcoin is never the first
  currency to come to peoples' mind.
The limited scripting, slow change rate and the biggest network made Bitcoin our
  choice:
The script limitation poses a real challenge in the protocol presented, making this
  an open problem.
As we discussed at section~\ref{sec:discussion_previous_work}, the problem has
  many implemented solutions for currencies with more expressive scripting
  languages;
The slow change rate helps to keep the currency value and the same rules from
  the start to the end of a bet, this makes the platform suitable for long term
  bets;
Finally, having the largest network enforcing the protocol rules makes more
  difficult some known attacks, as Majority and Eclipse
  \cite{heilman2015eclipse}.
Where attackers can overtake the control of the network or part of it.
Other cost of using a limited scripting language is the amount of instructions
  and transactions required to express the protocol, this is traduced to a
  higher fee cost.

The cost of running our proposed algorithm is prohibitively expensive for many
  cases.
But we think there is people willing to pay the cost when doing bet on large
  sums of money, as the cost of the protocol would represent a small fraction of
  the bet.
As there is no increase in the cost with the amount of money involved.

Most of the transaction required by the protcol are called ``Non standard''
  in Bitcoin.
Meaning even they are valid transactions and everyione recognizes them as that.
Most of the miners will not mine them, so likely submitting the transactions
  will take more time than a standard one.
We hope new proposals that makes use of this available features, like this one,
  can move the Bitcoin community to embrace this ``non estandard'' transactions.

Gambling is a really big and heavily regulated industry, Winsomeio, oraclizeit
  and this protocol are tools  to make this industry more flexible.
Allowing people to fully control its money while gambling, a difference from
  the regular casinos or bet sites.
As cryptocurrencies allows people to stay away from a centralized government
  issuer, this kind of tools allows people to steo out from centralized gambling
  sites.
There is yet another big difference, people running protocols on top of
  blockchains can see every line of code executed and how decissions are taken,
  making gambling a transparent process, opossed as it is today.
Where people uses only the public interface of a web site or physical casino.
Never seeing what is really going on ``behind the scenes''.

One of the most challenging problems to resolve for this protocol was to
  translate the protocol restrictions to Bitcoin transactions.
Studied existing solutions are composed just by one or two different
  transactions.
In Ethereum one smart contract is enough for the applications we discussed at
  section~\ref{sec:previous_work}.
For orisi, only one transaction is post in the blockchain with the bet, all
  the other communication and set up required happens outside the blockchain.
Our protocol uses the blochain widely, not only for money transfers, but also
  for oracle discovery and initial communication.
This seeks to avoid extra dependecies and keep most of the protocol expressed
  in the same framework.
This come to a cost, more and larger transactions.
Which are not free anymore, for each byte we post in the blockchain within
  a transaction we are charged by the miner.
This cost is discussed at section~\ref{sec:cost_analysis}

\colorbox{red}{Future work}
We also see value in transforming the oracles in ``judges'', and instead of
  betting on an uncertain outcome, let the judges decide between players
  controversy, acting as arbiter.
Small adjustements would be required to the protocol, as removing the random
  selection, probably judges will be agreed beforehand by the players.
Other required change is to remove the penalization by answering different
  from the majority.
It is perfectly fine and possible to have different opinions among the
  judges, and the ones with the minority should not be punished.
