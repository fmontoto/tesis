\section{Overview}

We split the protocol to make clear which part of it is optional and can be
  skipped if players can agree in a set of oracles.
In this subsection we present an overview before the full explanation of the
  protocol.

\subsection{First part: Oracle selection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first step is to compile a list of available oracles, we use the
      blockchain as decentralized database.
      Everyone willing to be an oracle can send a transaction to register into
      the blockchain.
      Players can compile the list from all registered oracles or might apply
      some filter; eg time of registration or if the oracle already participate
      in a previous bet.
  \item Players negotiate the bet parameters required for this step, as the
      number of oracles to use.
  \item In order to decide which oracles to use, the oracles need to pick a
      subset of the list compiled, they do this by running a distributed
      coin tossing protocol.
    With this, they can be sure the list generated is a random subset of the
      full list. If the list is big enough, the chance of one user controlling
      the oracles gets smaller. As it would be too expensive to control almost
      all the oracles in the list.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Second part: The Bet}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Players negotiate bet parameters as the fees to the oracles, the bet
      resolution timeout, the amount of money to gamble, the winner on each
      outcome of the event, the oracles penalties on misbehavior, etc..
  \item Players build, sign and send a transaction to the blockchain with the
      bet description, including the IDs of the oracles they want to decide the
      winner.
    We call this transaction ``Bet promise'', as the players commit to the bet
      by placing it. The wage is also on it.
    The other purpose of this transaction is to invite the oracles to
      participate in the bet, we make its ID public so they can identify itself
      and enroll to participate as oracles.
  \item The oracles will see the transaction asking them to participate in the
      bet, they will evaluate it and, if they are interested.
    They will reply with a transaction containing a reference to the ``Bet
      promise'' transacation and a deposit as commitment that they will
      participate in the process.
  \item When the players see the answer from the expected number of oracles,
  	  they will send the ``Bet'' transaction with funds of the bet and the
  	  oracles' reward.
  	If not enough oracles reply to the call, a second invitation can be send to
  	  a different set of oracles to fill the available spots.
  \item As soon as the bet event takes place, oracles are able to collect its
  	  payment from the Bet transaction. This payment gets available by making
  	  public, -voting- by the winner.
  	After the threshold number of oracles collect its payment, the winner player
  	  is able to collect its prize, its private key and the oracle votes are
  	  required to get it.
  \item After a second timeout, players can take the deposit from the oracles
  	  that did not participate in the bet resolution.
\end{enumerate}
