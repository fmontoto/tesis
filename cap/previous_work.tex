\section{Orisi}
Orisi is a distributed system for bitcoin smart contracts that relies in
  multiple oracles to bring information from outside of the blockchain.
Both players agree on 7 oracles to be used to decide the bet, usually chosen
  from ``The Oracle List'', a curated list with oracles. But could also be
  chosen from any other place the players want. Then, a multisignature
  address is generated to store the money while the bet takes place. This
  address

It works over bitcoin by using multisig address to keep the money during
  the bet.
  Both participants select 7 oracles nodes between both participants and money gets
  transferred to a multisignature address. A multisignature address is an
  address defined by a set of \texttt{m} addresses and a number \texttt{n}
  that defines the number of required signatures from the \texttt{m} keys.
