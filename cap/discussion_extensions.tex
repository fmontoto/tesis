\section{Extensions}

If we step out a little bit, the proposed protocol uses paid oracles to get a
  binary answer about an event outside the blockchain.
This is useful not only for betting on some outcome.
The oracles are oblivious to the protocol in which their answer is used; they
  get paid anyway.
Further applications of the protocol can be generalized from our proposal.
Resolution of contractual disputes is an interesting topic, where parties agree
  to use arbitrator(s) to decide two conflicting interpretations of a contract,
  for example.
In this example oracles takes part in the protocol more like judge than oracle.
So, it would make sense to paid the oracle for providing an answer instead of
  providing the same that the majority provides.
To extend the proposed protocol we can remove the output with the penalty on
  wrong answer.

Other possible extension would be to have not just untrusted and randomly
  selected oracles to decide the bet.
It could be interesting to add semi-trusted oracles, services of oracles could
  be created and used.
This might require to pay differently to the oracles, semi-trusted oracles could
  charge more for participate than the ones from the list.
Our protocol was proposed with the assumption each oracles is the equivalent,
  therefore they get paid the same, but it also may be extended to support
  different rewards and penalties per oracle.
