\subsection{Second part: The bet}

\subsubsection{Bet Promise}
Once players decided the oracles to use, whether using the \textit{Oracle
  Selection} part or by any other mean.
They need to agree in the terms of the bet, the event and who is the winner on
  each outcome, the time available for the oracles to answer, money required by
  each player, fees of the  oracles, deposit required to the oracles, etc..
Once all the bet parameters are set, they are serialized and its hash is
  calculated, players puts all the money required to run the protocol,
  including fees and the prize into a transaction.
The selected oracles, bet hash and a method\footnote{For instance an URL to a
  website with the bet description. Oracles are responsible to check the
  description fetched with the hash provided in the transaction.} to get the
  transaction full description are appended to this transaction in plain text
  and the transaction is sent to the blockchain.
We call this transaction ``\textit{Bet Promise}'', as it is a commitment from both
  players to the bet.

The commitment consists in paying the transaction fees\footnote{This money is
  gone forever.}, and to move all the money required by the BET into the control
  of both players.
Any other transaction with this money needs the approval from both, however in
  the case one of the player dissapear and does not participate anymore in the
  protocol, most of it is return \colorbox{red}{Hablar de la plata que va a los

\subsubsection{Oracle Inscription}
Oracles invited to participate needs to retrieve the Bet description as
  instructed in the \textit{Bet Promise} transaction and decide whether to
  participate or not.
When an oracle does not participate, players decide how to select a new one,
  a waiting list is recommended to be selected in the first part of the
  protocol.
When it decides to participate, it builds and send to the players

  transaction.

This transaction also binds the hash...

This transaction is the oracle's commitment with the bet, and the acceptance
  from the users. The inputs comes from the Oracle's deposit and the players
  joint account, some of it goes to an account controlled by the oracle and
  the players. The left portion goes to a
  A deposit from the oracle, and money from the players is
  moved into an account controlled by the players and the oracle, and
