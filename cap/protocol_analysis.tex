\section {Payments analysis}

Most of the bibliography read simplifies the fee transactions to be 0,
  as this was the the cost of it for a long time.
However as bitcoin use has increased, transactions are not free anymore
  \footnote{We can still send transactions with no fees to the blochain, but it
    might take forever for them to get into it. As miner will prioritize
    transactions with fee to collect.}, that's why we kept the fees in the
  explanation.
So we can do the analysis with all the costs, not only the oracle payment.

In Bitcoin, fees are charged by byte, therefore bigger transactions will pay more
  money as fee.
No matter how much money they spend.

At the moment we write this work, transactions paying 120 satoshi\footnote{A
  satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin on the blockchain. It is a one hundred
  millionth of a single bitcoin ($1^{-8}$).} usually gets into the next mined
  block.
So we will use this value as a reference for the cost of the protocol.

It's impossible to give an exact value for the size of each transaction, as
  addresses and signatures do not have a fixed size, for the analysis we use
  average values, the fluctuation is under 5\%.
Table \ref{tab:tx_fees} has the size for the transactions used in the protocol,
  sizes are in bytes:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \textbf{Transaction} & \textbf{Constant size} &
        \textbf{Per oracle size} & \textbf{Total Size} &
        \textbf{Fee [satoshi]} \\
      \hline
        Oracle Registration & 239 & 0 & 239 & \num{33460} \\
      \hline
        Bet Promise & 1267 & 65 & 1722 & \num{241080} \\
      \hline
        Oracle Inscription & 776 & 0 & 776 & \num{108640} \\
      \hline
        Bet & 617 & 445 & 3732 & \num{522480} \\
      \hline
      \hline
        Player redeem prize & 511 & 150 & 1561 & 218540 \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \captionof{table}{Transactions size and fee.}
    \label{tab:tx_fees}
\end{center}



The payment of the oracle's is not the only cost of this protocol.
There is a not insignificant number of transactions in the protocol, as there
  is a fee by each transaction in the Blockchain, this makes the protocol more
  expensive.
This is a problem for small bets, the presented protocols is prohibitively
  expensive for bet of just a few dollars. At least with the current fee costs
  of bitcoin.
