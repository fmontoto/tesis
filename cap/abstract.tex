Every time we place a bet, we implicitly trust the other participant or the
  institution which holds the bet to pay in the case we win.
For this reason we do not bet directly with people we do not know or trust,
  and we use a casino or other gambling sites.
Expecting the law or casino reputation to enforce good behavior.\\

Cryptocurrencies made possible to store and transfer value easily without
  using centralized currencies.
And since its populariation, many decentralized applications on top of them
  have been proposed and implemented.
Among them, gambling.
It is currently possible to safely bet with an stranger on a random events
  using cryptocurrencies.
Neither trust nor centralized entities are required.
In this work we propose a protocol on top of Bitcoin to place bets depending on
  real world events in a decentralized and trustless fashion.
\noindent
Our protocol uses a set ``oracles'' to bring the outcome of the bet's event into
  the blockchain.
When a certain threshold of the oracles have reported the same outcome for
  the event we unlock the winner's prize.
Protocol was designed to move the money to one of the players in the bet,
  oracles do not take control of the prize, they only decide between two
  possible outcomes.\\
\noindent
Economic incentives are placed to encourage good behavior of the participants,
  oracles get paid if and only if they provide the right answer, defined as the
  answer provided by the majority of them.
They are required to place a deposit to participate.
This allows the protocol to establish economic penalties if the oracle does not
  answer or does it wrong.\\
\noindent
Once the bet is placed, the prize is locked waiting for the oracles' answer,
  players lose the control of the money until the oracles decide the winner
  or a previously defined timeout is exceeded.
In which case each player gets half of the prize.\\
\noindent
Using Bitcoin scripting language the protocol guarantees fairness and correct
  execution with a dishonest minority of oracles and a dishonest peer, once the
  bet is placed.
Before the bet is placed a dishonest peer can cause limited economic damage to
  an honest player.
With an attack cost equal to the damage inflicted.
Dishonest oracles, before the bet is placed, can cause small economic damage to
  both players equally, the cost for this attack is a parameter set by the
  players.\\
\noindent
The protocol was implemented and run in the Bitcoin testnet using the official
  client to verify the transactions.
Discussion on the trade off between the protocol cost and economic incentives
  for the participants
  The trade off between the protocol cost and economic incentives are discussed

Sample transaction and costs for running the protocol are presented and
  discussed
