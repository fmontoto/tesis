\section{Players}

Players are the ones wagering the money, within this work we define its number
  to 2, the idea behind this work can be extended to more than two players,
  however the code in the transactions gets more complicated, so transactions
  increase on size, this makes the protocol more expensive.

Players participate in the protocol with the expectation to predict the
  outcome of the event and win some money, they might not trust each other but
  they collaborate to build the transaction of this protocol, expecting to win.
The protocol lock the players' money before the event they are wagering on takes
  and let the oracles decide where the money goes, this prevent the losing
  player from not paying the bet.
As players are requesting the oracles' services they pay for it and the cost
  of transactions required in the protocol.
