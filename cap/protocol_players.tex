\section{Players}

Players are the ones providing the money.
In this work we only consider two party bets, the idea behind this work can be
extended to more than two players.
The code in the transactions, however,  gets more complicated, so transactions
  increase on size, which makes the protocol more expensive.

Players participate in the protocol with the expectation to predict the
  outcome of the event and to win some money, they might not trust each other but
  they collaborate to build the transaction of this protocol, expecting to win.
The protocol locks the players' money before the event and let the oracles
  decide where the money goes.
This prevents the losing player from not paying the bet.
Players pay for the oracles' services as well as the costs of all transactions
  required in the protocol.
