\section{The Protocol}

Our protocol is divided into two parts, where the second one is the actual bet
  and the first one is an optional step to select the oracles.

\subsection{First part: Oracle Selection}

The oracles are a key piece in the protocol, as they get to decide who get
  the prize money.
The first part of the protocol defines a way to select them in a trustless
  way.
The idea is quite simple, players selects from a list of oracles a subset
  to participate on its bet.
With a big enough list, selecting randomly from it reduces the
  chances from any of the participants to influence on the selection.

However, there are a few key properties in our protocol to reduce the chance
  of influencing their selection.

\subsubsection{Compiling the Oracle List}

In order to get a trustworthy list, we define a few key properties:
It must be a decentralized list; anybody willing to be an oracle can inscribe
  itself; and must be visible for both of the players.

As we saw in sub section \label{subsec:Blockchain}, we already have a
  public distributed database to store information.
We use the blockchain to keep the list of oracles, this provides tampering
  protection, a public database and a distributed source for the list.
In order to let anybody inscribe to be an oracle, the inscription is a simple
 transaction generated by the oracle sent to the blockchain.
